# NumberSystems
<br>
The numberSystems is a library to work with different number systems less than 17th<br>
This library can write how operations is happened<br>
<br>

Problems:<br>
		1. THIS LIBRARY CAN WORK ONLY WITH NUMBERS WHICH ARE GREATER THAN ZERO AND ZERO<br>
		2.IT DOES NOT CHECK ALL PARAMETRS<br>
    <br>
There are main functions:<br>
  1.Number() - creates an object by taking the number in the 10th number system (numberString='0.121');<br>
  2.create_number_from_string() - creates an object by taking the number in different number systems (number_string='12.12',system=3) <br>
  <br>
  This objects has some spesific functions, which are easy to understand by example (<a href='https://github.com/RomaTk/NumberSystems/blob/master/run.py'>run.py</a>)<br><br>
  
  I think that this is bad library however code can be taken to create or improve other libraries.
  WHY I have done that - directory "WHY"
